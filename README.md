In this game, you are a sprite that has to move through a course and as you move through, monsters randomly spawn and move towards you. Although you can move forwards and backwards with WASD, the entire screen still shifts and you can’t actually cause the screen to move faster than it is set to move. You can either shoot or dodge them as you move through the obstacle course. When you kill monsters, there is a random chance they drop power ups for your gunner. The game goes on forever (like flappy bird, jetpack joyride etc) and progressively gets harder as you get further through the game. For example, a person playing for the first time should be able to make it through about a minute of the game, and then someone who practices for a while should be able to make it through about 5 minutes (This means that it should very slowly get harder).
-	Difficulty is based off of two factors, the increasing number of monsters spawned and the speed that the screen moves.
There are single coins randomly placed throughout the map (like one per average 15 seconds) that you can collect and you can buy new skins for your gunner (no in game improvements). There are 4 extra skins worth 100, 250, 500, 1,000, and 10,000 coins.
Shooter
-	Single player - Should be able to use wasd and move the mouse around to aim at angles across the screen
-	Multiplayer – use WASD and arrow keys but you can’t shoot at an angle, removing the mouse element from the game

-	Hold q to shoot and use wasd for player one
-	Hold shift to shoot and use arrow keys for player two (Both 1 and 2 player options)

-	Power up: Shoots 2 bullets at once (15 seconds or until getting another power up)
-	Power up: invincible for 5 seconds
-	Power up: Random (50% chance your bullet speed quadruples, 50% chance your bullet speed halves)
Monsters:
-	Ones that try to fly straight into you (if they make contact you die)
